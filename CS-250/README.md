How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves active listening, empathizing with the user, 
and understanding the broader context in which the software will operate. 
User stories provide a concise and user-focused way to represent these needs. 
When crafted well, they put the user at the center and describe functionality 
in terms of value to the user. By focusing on user stories, we can prioritize 
and design features that truly cater to the user's requirements and bring tangible benefits.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is iterative and user-centric. 
I prioritize understanding the problem space, refining requirements,
and maintaining open communication with stakeholders. Agile methodologies, 
particularly the principles of continuous feedback and improvement, 
resonate with this approach. Moving forward, I hope to incorporate 
regular sprint retrospectives, backlog refinement, and daily stand-ups 
into my development process, ensuring that the team and I remain aligned, 
adaptable, and continuously delivering value.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development 
means more than just producing clean code. It 
involves actively communicating, being open to 
feedback, collaborating well with cross-functional 
teams, and always keeping the end-user's needs in mind. 
A good team member is proactive, accountable, and 
always looking for ways to uplift the team's morale, 
efficiency, and product quality.

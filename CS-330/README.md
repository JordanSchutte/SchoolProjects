How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software begins with understanding the problem space 
and envisioning the end user's interaction with the final product. For the 3D lamp scene,
I started by sketching a rough layout, focusing on user experience and aesthetic appeal. 
This project enhanced my design skills, particularly in 3D modeling and lighting, teaching 
me to consider how different elements contribute to the scene's overall atmosphere.

How do I approach developing programs?

Developing the 3D lamp scene required a blend of creativity and technical skills. 
I employed new development strategies, such as modular programming to separate concerns 
and improve code readability and reusability. Iteration was central to my development process; 
each component of the scene was developed, tested, and refined in cycles. This iterative 
approach allowed me to gradually build complexity, ensuring each element functioned as 
intended before moving on.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The skills and knowledge gained from working on computational graphics and visualizations 
have broad applications. Academically, they form a foundation for exploring more complex 
topics in computer science, such as virtual reality or game development. Professionally, 
these skills open opportunities in fields where visual content is critical, such as 
digital media, architecture, and simulation-based training.

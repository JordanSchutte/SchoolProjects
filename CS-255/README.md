Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was centered around creating a booking system for driving lessons. 
The client, DriverPass, sought to streamline their booking process by allowing users to 
select available dates, check instructor availability, and make secure payments. The goal 
was to design a system that is user-friendly and efficient, reducing manual processes and 
errors.

What did you do particularly well?
Throughout the project, I believe my strength was in effectively capturing and 
translating the client’s needs into functional requirements. The user stories 
and use-case diagrams I developed provided a clear roadmap for the project, ensuring 
that the design phase was closely aligned with the client’s vision.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If given a chance to revise, I would revisit the activity diagrams I created. While they 
captured the process flow, I feel I could have included more detailed alternate flows, 
which would provide a more holistic view of potential system interactions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to 
consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting user needs began with active listening during stakeholder meetings and refining those 
needs through iterative feedback. Using tools like user stories helped in aligning the design closely 
with user expectations. Considering user needs is pivotal because the end-user interacts with the 
system daily. If their requirements are not met, the software may not be utilized to its full potential 
or could even be entirely rejected, rendering the investment in development a loss.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze 
and design a system?
My approach to software design involves understanding the problem domain, capturing requirements 
through various elicitation techniques, and then translating these requirements into design 
artifacts using tools like UML. In the future, I'd lean more on prototyping as a strategy, as it 
allows stakeholders to interact with a mock version of the system, providing early feedback, which 
can be invaluable. Continuous communication with stakeholders, iterative design, and regular feedback 
loops will remain integral to my design process.

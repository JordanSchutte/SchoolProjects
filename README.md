# Corner Grocery App
This project will take the file CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt, take the words in the file,
count the frequency, and given the choice from the user, output information about it.

I think using the Python code that was able to read the file and write to a .dat file was
done very well.

A large improvement that could be done that was out of the scope of the initial project was 
adding an algorithm that would require more data but it would help recognize which products
are more popular than others and predict the next possible entry.

I struggled with the C++ side since I always struggle with choosing a path for the UI. I
frequently find myself getting half-way through a project then learning or finding a way
that looks and operates better and that makes me want to go back a re-write everything.

Learning how to combine multiple languages together will be a very useful skill that 
will be needed in future course work and projects.

Using good practices like naming fuctions for what they do and keeping them simple is 
a great way to make code readable and maintainable. Another great way to make a project 
adaptable is having different aspects separated. For example, Python is the part that
reads the file and does any potenial math, while C++ handles the user interface.

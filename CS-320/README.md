1.) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring functionality and security in code or software involves rigorous practices like systematic testing (including unit, integration, and penetration testing), continuous integration and deployment pipelines, adherence to secure coding standards, and regular updates and patches to address vulnerabilities.

2.) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs effectively is achieved through active engagement with users via surveys, interviews, and feedback sessions, which inform the creation of detailed user stories and personas that are directly incorporated into the software development lifecycle to ensure the final product aligns with user expectations and needs.

3.) How do I approach designing software?
Designing software is a systematic process that begins with understanding the project's scope and requirements, followed by conceptualizing a high-level architecture, then breaking down the complexity into manageable components or modules, and continuously iterating based on testing and feedback, all while adhering to established design principles and patterns.

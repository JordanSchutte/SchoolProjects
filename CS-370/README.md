# Pirate Intelligent Agent

## Project Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using deep Q-learning 
to navigate a maze environment. The agent, represented as a pirate, learns to 
find the optimal path to treasure while avoiding obstacles.

## Work Done

I was provided with starter code that included the maze environment setup, 
a basic neural network model, and functions for visualizing the maze. 
My primary contribution was implementing the Q-learning algorithm in 
the `qtrain` function. This involved:

1. Implementing the epsilon-greedy strategy for action selection
2. Creating the experience replay mechanism
3. Developing the training loop for the neural network
4. Balancing exploration and exploitation through epsilon decay

## Reflections on Computer Science

### The Role of Computer Scientists

Computer scientists solve complex problems by creating algorithmic solutions 
and implementing them through code. This matters because it allows us to automate 
tasks, analyze vast amounts of data, and create intelligent systems that can 
enhance various aspects of our lives, from healthcare to entertainment.

### Problem-Solving Approach

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by:

1. Clearly defining the problem and its constraints
2. Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components
3. Researching existing solutions and algorithms
4. Implementing a solution, often starting with a simple version and iteratively improving it
5. Rigorously testing and debugging the solution
6. Optimizing for efficiency and scalability

### Ethical Responsibilities

My ethical responsibilities include:

1. Ensuring the privacy and security of user data
2. Being transparent about the capabilities and limitations of the systems I create
3. Considering potential biases in my algorithms and working to mitigate them
4. Designing systems that are accessible and beneficial to a diverse range of users
5. Continuously evaluating the potential societal impacts of my work

This project has deepened my understanding of reinforcement learning and neural networks, 
showcasing how these techniques can be applied to solve complex decision-making problems. 
It has also highlighted the importance of ethical considerations in AI development, 
particularly in balancing system performance with user privacy and fairness.

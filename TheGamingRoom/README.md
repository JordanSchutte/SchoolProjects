Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client is a company seeking to develop a web-based version of their existing Android app, 
a team-based drawing game called "Draw It or Lose It." The web-based version should serve multiple platforms 
and allow for games with one or more teams, each having unique names. The software must also ensure that only 
one instance of the game exists in memory at any given time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
While developing this documentation, I effectively analyzed and addressed the client's requirements, 
provided a comprehensive comparison of various operating platforms, and made well-informed recommendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document provided a clear roadmap and structure, 
outlining the requirements, goals, and constraints of the project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, 
I would pick the section on security considerations. To improve it, 
I would conduct more in-depth research on the latest security best 
practices and emerging threats, ensuring that the proposed solutions 
are up-to-date and effective in addressing current risks.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully analyzing the client's requirements, 
and identifying the specific features and functionalities that would make the 
software useful and enjoyable for users. Considering the user's needs when designing 
software is crucial because it directly impacts user satisfaction, engagement, 
and the overall success of the application.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When designing software, I followed a structured approach, prioritizing user needs and 
focusing on scalability, performance, and modularity. Collaboration with stakeholders, 
users, and developers is essential for refining the design and ensuring alignment. 
Embracing an iterative process helps adapt to changing requirements and maintain 
relevance in the long run.

1.) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a client dedicated to providing comprehensive financial services. Their concern was the security of their software systems, specifically addressing potential vulnerabilities that could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data and services. They required a thorough vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices to fortify their software infrastructure.

2.) What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
In identifying software security vulnerabilities for Artemis Financial, I excelled in conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment that scrutinized various layers of the application. Secure coding is crucial as it forms the first line of defense against cyber threats. By coding securely, we safeguard sensitive data, ensure service availability, and instill customer trust, thereby enhancing the company's reputation and market value.

3.) What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment was particularly challenging when dealing with false positives and determining the severity of the vulnerabilities found. However, this process was enlightening as it underscored the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest security threats and mitigation techniques.

4.) How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I fortified security by implementing multiple layers of protection, including secure coding practices, input validation, authentication protocols, and encryption. For future projects, I would employ tools like static code analysis, dynamic scanning, and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities. Additionally, I would stay up-to-date on cybersecurity trends and apply risk assessment matrices to prioritize and address vulnerabilities effectively.

5.) How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, 
how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the functionality and security of the application, I conducted unit testing, system testing, and integration testing after refactoring the code. Post-refactoring, I utilized regression testing and vulnerability scanning tools to ascertain that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

6.) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Throughout this project, I leveraged various resources and tools, including OWASP resources, static and dynamic analysis tools, and updated secure coding guidelines. These practices, coupled with a commitment to continuous learning and adaptation, will be invaluable for future tasks and professional development.

7.) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, 
knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In the "Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report" I demonstrated my adeptness in implementing robust cybersecurity measures, such as the SHA-256 algorithm and SSL/TLS protocols, to enhance application security. My methodical approach to testing ensured functionality and security, while my adherence to industry best practices highlighted my comprehensive understanding of real-world cybersecurity applications. This project stands as a testament to my technical skills, strategic problem-solving, and commitment to continuous learning and application in cybersecurity.
